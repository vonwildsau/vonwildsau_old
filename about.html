      <h4>About vonwildsau</h4>
      
      <h5>His name is <b style="color:#5555aa">Nico Stettler</b>, vonwildsau is his nom du pilote. The name originated in 2011 when he started racing Cyclekarts; which are handmade single-seater cars built to resemble race cars from the 1920s. He built the first electric cyclekart in 2014 but has since left the engines behind and enjoys spending too much money on building bicycles.
         <br>
        <br>
      With a brief 3 year stint as a stage manager he now builds temporary structures for several art organizations and by pure chance seems to be bartending for swiss circuses every summer. 
      <br>
      <br>
        To finance his costly hobbies, Nico has been studying Environmental Sciences since 2017; focusing on GIS analysis and Web Based Mapping. He is available for hire in the Non-Profit and Environmental Sector.</h5>
